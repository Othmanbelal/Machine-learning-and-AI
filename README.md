## BalanceBot_ParameterEstimation

### Overview
The BalanceBot_ParameterEstimation project is an exploratory journey into the fascinating intersection of robotics and machine learning, focusing on the development and implementation of algorithms to maintain the balance of a two-wheeled robot. This repository contains all the necessary code, documentation, and resources used to derive the equations of motion, estimate essential parameters through linear regression, and simulate the balancing act using Python.

### Objectives
- **Parameter Estimation:** Utilize linear regression to estimate unknown parameters crucial for the robot's balance.
- **Equations of Motion:** Derive and implement the mathematical models that govern the robot's dynamics.
- **Simulation and Visualization:** Create simulations to test and visualize the robot's performance using Pygame, providing insights into the effectiveness of the implemented control strategies.

### Tools and Libraries
This project is implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy for numerical calculations, SciPy for more advanced mathematical functions, and Pygame for rendering and visualization purposes. These tools have been instrumental in simulating the physical environment and dynamics of the balancing robot.
